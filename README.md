# AGC Mockup (Phase 2)

This mockup has the following enhancements to the Phase 1 mockup:
* Several screens have a "help" icon which takes them to a help page for that screen.
* There is a "data_model" directory that contains simple classes that implement a "database" for each type of collection. This enables screens to populate themselves by accessing data from a "database" instance, rather than from hardcoded data within the class. 

## Installation

After downloading, cd into the directory and invoke:

```
flutter run
```

On my platform, that brings up the iOS simulator and the following:

```
$ flutter run
